# BAMAZON STORE

In this activity, I create an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


**Instructionst**

## Repository:
https://github.com/enricb94/bamazon.git

### Open your Terminal : 

## install the package (mysql, inquirer)
npm install


**node bamazonCustomer.js**

   The app should then prompt users with two messages.

   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

    * Add to Inventory
    
    * Add New Product
